## Problem Statement:
*	Unavailability of a platform
    Unavailability of a platform that serves as a single solution for paint, decor and interior design and the one's that exist are highly brand specific and not available to use of common people.
*	Lack of visualisation and clarification among people
    People don't have tools for visualizing clearly how furniture would look in their own space Choosing the right paint for the house is all fun until it all turns into a quite tricky and tiring process for everyone. Now, thanks to augmented reality, users can easily try different colour options, create custom palettes, and share results in a variety of ways.
*	Most presentation platforms don't have a support centre available
    Collaborate in real-time with your teammates. Share tasks and work simultaneously to create a powerful presentation.

## Solution
*	Our novel idea to solve the issue is an Augmented Reality based Application for Interior Designing.
*	Using our services, one may easily create or change colour of his/her house by just going through different selections. 
*	Onboarding of retailers so that Customers can easily access different Services on the tip of their fingers.
